Hello! My name is Daniel Aguilar Gomes and this is my personal website. I am [Brazilian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mKe_POi_gaQ) and I am a PhD candidate in Mathematics, at [IMECC - Unicamp](https://ime.unicamp.br) under the supervision of [Régis Varão](https://ime.unicamp.br/~regisvarao).

I have a bachelor's and master's degree in Mathematics from [Unicamp](https://unicamp.br). During my PhD, I did a research internship at [Université de Mons](https://web.umons.ac.be/) under the supervision of [Karl Grosse-Erdmann](https://math.umons.ac.be/ps/fr/kggrosseerdmann/index.html).

My research area is Linear Dynamics, which lies in the intersection between Dynamical Systems and Functional Analysis. I am also interested in Ergodic Theory.
